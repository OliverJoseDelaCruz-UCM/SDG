                    <h2>Why was GOAL: Clean Water & Sanitation created?</h2>
                    <p>
                        This goal was created because access to safe water and
                         proper sanitation is one of the most basic human needs, yet millions of people
                          around the world still do not have it. Before the Sustainable Development Goals
                           were formed in 2015, the world faced a serious water crisis: rivers were polluted,
                            many communities had no toilets, diseases spread easily through dirty water, and 
                            climate change made clean water even harder to find. These problems affected people’s
                             health, education, and economic opportunities, especially in poor and rural areas.</p>

                    <p>Our goal is to address these urgent challenges.
                         It aims to ensure that every person has reliable access to safe drinking water, clean toilets, and proper hygiene.
                          At the same time, it focuses on protecting the environment by preventing water pollution, improving wastewater treatment,
                           and managing water resources responsibly. SDG 6 exists because without clean water and sanitation,
                            sustainable development is impossible; communities cannot stay healthy, children cannot attend school,
                             and countries cannot grow.

                        <p>2. Sanitation and Hygiene Provide households and public spaces with toilets and promote handwashing to prevent diseases.</p>
                        <p>3. Reduce Water Pollution Stop dumping garbage, chemicals, and wastewater into rivers, seas, and lakes.</p>
                        <p>4. Improve Water Efficiency Use water wisely in agriculture, households, and industries.</p>
                        <p>5. Integrated Water Resource Management Countries must plan water use responsibly between cities, farms, industries, and nature.</p>
                        <p>6. Protect Water Ecosystems Take care of wetlands, rivers, lakes, groundwater, and watersheds.</p>
                        <p>7. International Cooperation Help countries that lack clean water systems through technology, funding, and training.</p>

                    <h2>How can we help achieving this?</h2>

                    <p>We can help achieve our goal by using water responsibly in our daily lives,
                         such as taking shorter showers, fixing leaks, and turning off the tap while brushing our teeth.
                          Proper waste disposal is also important because throwing garbage, oils,
                           or chemicals into drains and waterways pollutes water sources. Supporting community clean-up drives,
                            tree-planting programs, and river rehabilitation projects can help protect natural water systems.
                             Practicing good hygiene—especially handwashing with soap—and promoting awareness about clean water
                              and sanitation encourages healthier communities. Finally, we can advocate for water-saving technologies,
                               support organizations that build safe water systems, and educate others about the importance of conserving
                                and protecting our water resources. Through these simple yet collective actions, everyone can contribute to
                                 achieving a greater future.
